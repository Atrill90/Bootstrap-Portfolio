        <p>If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.

                There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.
                
                We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Here's something that's fun. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them.
                
                We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Get tough with it, get strong. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.
                
                You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. You are only limited by your imagination.
                
                And right there you got an almighty cloud. There are no limits in this world. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.
                
                Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. You need the dark in order to show the light. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.
